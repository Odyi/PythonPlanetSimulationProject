This python project took around a month, 
i was learning python and someone told me about pygame and how to visualize the code and I thought that was pretty sick 
so I used most of my time to make a planet simulation which i thought would work nice, 
the code works alright but the planets keep crashing into each other because  its 2d,
but the code has randomly generated stars which was pretty slick.
